        The ARIES team works with virtual and augmented reality to create hands
        on learning experiences. I first came in contact with the team after my
        friend <a href="http://historyviz.com/portfolio/dillon">Dillon</a> told
        me about a project he was working on with the team. The CI-SPY project
        used AR to recreate a, now mostly destroyed, historic black school. I
        think this sort of material is extremely valuable; any time invested
        towards creating new ways to learn and solidifying history in a way that
        may be more digestible is worth it. I currently am working on a few
        sports simulators where the project aim is to help injured or otherwise
        benched players refine their tactics.

          I began cooking here after hearing about, then trying, their delicious
          food. As I wanted to further improve my knife skills and palette it
          was a good fit. I've learned, and am mastering, different cuts (e.g.
          julienne, chiffonade, brunoise), how to manage multiple dishes at
          once, and American cooking.

          I began cooking here after a friend offered me an "in" as a cook. I
          accepted their offer as I wanted to explore a childhood dream, being a
          cook. It was a lovely job, yet extremely taxing. I learned finer
          aspects of cooking (e.g. quenelles, plating techniques) and used
          modern cooking machinery (e.g. sous vides, vacuum sealers). After a
          year or so I quit and reentered academia to finish my bachlor's
          degree.

        <p class="subtitle is-5">AM Director & Traffic Director 2014-2016</p>
        <p>
          I began working at this radio station in 2013 in hopes of expanding my
          musical taste and deepening my musical knowledge. I later was offered
          the position of Traffic Director. As the Traffic Director I was in
          charge of a group of 16 individuals who, along with myself, were to
          create automated, yet tasteful, traffic (essentially playlists) for
          the station. As the AM Director I was in charge of 40+ individuals who
          were in the process of training to become certified DJs. During that
          time I created an online
          <a href="https://www.wuvt.vt.edu/am-guide">guide</a> to assist DJs
          when I was not available. This guide is still in use today.
